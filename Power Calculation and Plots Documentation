%% Power Calculation and Plots Documentation

% Description:
% This script calculates and plots the received power at different distances
% using a log-loss model. It considers a single frequency and assumes an
% access point transmitting at a specified power level. The received power
% is calculated based on the log-loss model and plotted against the distance
% from the remote radio head (RRH).

% Clear workspace, command window, and close all figures

% Set the frequency and transmit power
f1 = 1.9;               % Frequency in GHz
Pt = 1;                 % Transmit power in Watts

% Convert transmit power to dBm
PtdBm = 10 * log10(Pt / 1e-3);

% Convert frequency to Hz and define speed of light
f = f1 * 10^9;          % Frequency in Hz
c = 3 * 10^8;           % Speed of light in m/s

% Calculate wavelength
lambda = c / f;

% Define distance range and reference distance for free space path loss
d = [0:10:1000];        % Distance in meters
d_freespace = 100;      % Reference distance assumed to be in free space

% Define path loss model parameters
n = 2.6;                % Path loss exponent
sigma = 14.1;          % Log-normal shadowing standard deviation

% Calculate path loss using the log-loss model
L = GenLog_Lossmodel_n(f, d_freespace, d, n, sigma);

% Calculate the received power at the mobile receiver
Pmob = PtdBm - L;

% Plot the received power vs. distance
plot(d, Pmob, 'LineWidth', 3);
grid on;
title('Rx power (assuming 1W at the Tx output)');
grid on;
set(gca, 'FontSize', 14);
xlabel('Distance from RRH');
ylabel('Received Power in dBm');
hold on;

% Generate a semilog plot of the received power vs. distance
figure;
semilogx(d, Pmob,'LineWidth',3);
grid on;
set(gca,'FontSize',14);
xlabel('Distance in m');
ylabel('Received Power in dBm');
title('Semilog plot');
